This mouse pointer
is an attempt
to create the simplest possible
useful mouse pointer
that is controlled by your voice.

The most pointer will start moving 
when you start hissing.
The mouse pointer will stop moving
when you stop hissing.



Part of this simplicity of this mouse pointer
is that you do not control the direction.
Instead,
You will notice that the mouse pointer
makes a ninety degree turn to the right
every time you stop hissing.
What this means is that you can get to any place on the screen
in a series of right hand turns.


The idea for this mouse comes from
the fact that mail truck drivers
only make right hand turns
and are still able to deliver the mail to everyone in the town.

By default,
the crosshairs for the mouse pointer
appear when you start hissing
and disappear when you stop hissing
.
You can toggle them to show permanently
with the voice command:



```
toggle crosshairs
```
